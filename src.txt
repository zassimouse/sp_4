the waitForMultipleObjects function determines whether the wait criteria have been met if the criteria have not been met, the calling thread enters the wait state until the conditions of the wait criteria have been met or the time-out interval elapses
when bWaitAll is true, the function's wait operation is completed only when the states of all objects have been set to signaled the function does not modify the states of the specified objects until the states of all objects have been set to signaled
 for example, a mutex can be signaled, but the thread does not get ownership until the states of the other objects are also set to signaled in the meantime, some other thread may get ownership of the mutex, thereby setting its state to nonsignaled
